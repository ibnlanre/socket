`@ibnlanre/socket` is a fast, lightweight, and type-safe WebSocket client built to supercharge your developer experience (DX). Designed with a cache-first approach and flexible configuration, it makes managing WebSocket connections effortless and efficient.

This library is optimized for delivering a superior user experience. Its cache-first design makes your app feel faster by providing instant access to stored data while fetching updates in the background. Meanwhile, the retry mechanism ensures uninterrupted real-time data flow, so your users never miss a beat.

## Features

- **Blazing-Fast Caching**: Keeps previously received data readily available, with background updates to ensure speed and freshness.
- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Seamlessly integrates live data updates into your app.
- **Subscription Management**: Easy and intuitive APIs for managing multiple WebSocket subscriptions.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically re-establishes connections during network hiccups or server downtime to minimize disruptions.

To get started with the `@ibnlanre/socket` library, follow these steps:

1. Install the library using a package manager.
2. Create a socket client using the `createSocketClient` function.
3. Use the client in your components to subscribe to data streams and handle updates.

## Usage

### Creating a Socket Client

To create a socket client, use the `createSocketClient` function.

```tsx
import { createSocketClient, SocketCloseCode } from "@ibnlanre/socket";

type StockMarketOverview = {
  last_updated: string;
  notifications: {
    summary: {
      status: string;
      last_updated: string;
      notifications: {
        total_securities: string;
        listed_contracts: string;
        boards: Array<{ name: string; code: string; }>;
      };
      is_post_connection: string;
    };
  };
};

type StockMarketOverviewParams = {
  currency?: string;
};

const client = createSocketClient<
  StockMarketOverview,
  StockMarketOverviewParams
>({
  baseURL: "wss://new.base.url/",
  url: "/ws/new-endpoint/market_overview/unique_id",
  retryDelay: 2000,
  minJitterValue: 0.9,
  retryCount: 5,
  retryOnSpecificCloseCodes: [SocketCloseCode.AbnormalClosure],
  retryOnCustomCondition: (event, socket) => {
    return event.code === SocketCloseCode.PROTOCOL_ERROR

### Returns

Calling the `createSocketClient` function returns a client object with the following properties:

- `initialize`: A function to initialize the socket client.
- `use`: Subscribes to a data stream and returns the data, loading state, and error.
- `sockets`: A map of WebSocket connections created by the client.

### Subscribing to a WebSocket Connection

To subscribe to a WebSocket connection, use the `use` hook provided by the client object. This hook returns an object containing the data, status, metadata, and actions for managing the WebSocket connection.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  const { data, isPending } = client.use({ currency: "USD" }, (data) => {
    if (!data) return;
    return data.notifications.summary.notifications;
  });

  if (isPending) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Stock Market Overview</h1>
      <p>Total Securities: {data?.totalSecurities}</p>
      <p>Listed Contracts: {data?.listedContracts}</p>
      <p>Boards: {data?.boards.map(({ name }) => name).join(", ")}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Parameters

The `use` hook accepts the following parameters:

- `params`: The parameters to pass to the WebSocket connection.
- `select`: A function to transform the data before updating the component.

### Returns

Calling the `use` hook subscribes to the WebSocket connection and returns the following properties:

**Actions**

- `close`: A function to close the WebSocket connection.
- `open`: A function to open the WebSocket connection.
- `send`: A function to send a message to the WebSocket server.

**Handlers**

- `on`: Subscribes to a specific WebSocket event.

**State**
