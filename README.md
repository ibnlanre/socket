#### Status

- `isPending`: A boolean indicating whether the data is loading or not.
- `isError`: A boolean indicating whether an error occurred or not.
- `isSuccess`: A boolean indicating whether the data was successfully fetched or not.
- `isStaleData`: A boolean indicating whether the data is stale or not.
- `isPlaceholderData`: A boolean indicating whether the data is a placeholder or not.
- `isRefetching`: A boolean indicating whether the data is being refetched or not.
