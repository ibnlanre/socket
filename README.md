`@ibnlanre/socket` is a fast, lightweight, and type-safe WebSocket client built to supercharge your developer experience (DX). Designed with a cache-first approach and flexible configuration, it makes managing WebSocket connections effortless and efficient.

This library is optimized for delivering a superior user experience. Its cache-first design makes your app feel faster by providing instant access to stored data while fetching updates in the background. Meanwhile, the retry mechanism ensures uninterrupted real-time data flow, so your users never miss a beat.

## Features

- **Blazing-Fast Caching**: Keeps previously received data readily available, with background updates to ensure speed and freshness.
- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Seamlessly integrates live data updates into your app.
- **Subscription Management**: Easy and intuitive APIs for managing multiple WebSocket subscriptions.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically re-establishes connections during network hiccups or server downtime to minimize disruptions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the `@ibnlanre/socket` library, follow these steps:

1. Install the library using a package manager.
2. Create a socket client using the `createSocketClient` function.
3. Use the client in your components to subscribe to data streams and handle updates.
